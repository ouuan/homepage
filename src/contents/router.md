I worked with two teammates to build an IPv6 router on an FPGA board. We used SystemVerilog to implement basic neighbor discovery and packet forwarding. We also built a RISC-V CPU on the FPGA to run software that implements the RIPng routing protocol and maintains a tree-based data structure for efficient forwarding table lookups. The software communicates with the hardware to update and manage forwarding decisions in real time.
