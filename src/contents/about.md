My name is Yufan You (pronounced “Yoo-fahn Yoh”). I am a master's student at [NISL@THU](https://netsec.ccert.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Jianjun Chen](https://www.jianjunchen.com/). I received my B.Sc. (Hons) in Information and Computing Science at Tsinghua University in 2025.

My research focuses on **Network, Protocol, and Web Security**. I am particularly interested in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities arising from parser differentials and semantic gaps between protocol implementations.

Besides network security research, I also enjoy solving CTF challenges, Web development (e.g., the page you are visiting), and programming in Rust with Neovim on Arch Linux.
