My name is Yufan You (pronounced “Yoo-fahn Yoh”). I am an undergraduate student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), graduating in July. I will continue at Tsinghua as a graduate student under the supervision of [Prof. Jianjun Chen](https://www.jianjunchen.com/).

My research focuses on **Network, Protocol, and Web Security**. I am particularly interested in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities arising from parser differentials and semantic gaps between protocol implementations.

Besides network security research, I also enjoy solving CTF challenges, Web development (e.g., the page you are visiting), and programming in Rust with Neovim on Arch Linux.
