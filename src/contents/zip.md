We discovered semantic gaps between 50 ZIP parsers across 19 languages, where different parsers read different contents from the same ZIP file. We provided detailed analysis of the parsing ambiguities and demonstrated their impacts in real-world exploitation scenarios. Our findings were assigned 3 CVEs and rewarded by Gmail, Coremail, and Zoho.
